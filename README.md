Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Asma Fathima

My passion lies in analytics, and I possess a background in Business Analytics. While pursuing computer science during undergrad, data analysis wasn't exactly on my radar. However, my interest grew as I learned coding and different programming languages. Data analysis has become a major part of my work, and I'm excited to keep exploring and developing my skills in this fascinating and rapidly evolving field. I am currently learning  R, Python, Apache Spark, Machine Learning, and I aspire to continue my learning journey in this field. Currently, I am working as a Business Operations Specialist and recently completed a Masters in Management Analytics from Smith School of Business at Queen's University.
